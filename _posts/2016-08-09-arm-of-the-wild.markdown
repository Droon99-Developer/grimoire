**2nd-level transmutation**

**Casting Time**: 1 bonus action

**Range**: Self

**Components**: V, S

**Duration**: Concentration, up to 1 minute

You transform one of your arms into an extendable vine whose end
sticks to any surface that it touches. The arm cannot be used to wield
any objects or weapons. As you cast the spell and on every turn within
the duration, you can make either of the following actions:
Grab Creature. As a bonus action, you extend your vine arm
forward, attempting to pull one creature you choose within 20 feet of
you. The target must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or be pulled
10 feet directly towards you.
Grab Surface. As either a bonus action on your turn or a reaction to
when you fall, you extend your vine arm forward, pulling yourself to a
hard surface such as a wall or ceiling within 20 feet of you. If this
movement would cause you to be suspended off the ground, you
remain so until you take an action or the concentration ends.
